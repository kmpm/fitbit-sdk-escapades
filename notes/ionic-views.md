Ionic Views
===========

This is a micro framework / module that can be found at
https://github.com/gaperton/ionic-views that there is a 
sample of using here.

The sample here is a modified version of what I found in the
development branch of https://github.com/gaperton/ionic-views/
at Jan 07 2018.
